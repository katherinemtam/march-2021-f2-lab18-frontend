# Met Museum Artworks

This lab gets artworks from the met museum API and let's you search for specific titles. You can also favorite the artworks you like and unfavorite them when you are no longer interested in them.

## Usage

Go to https://awesome-ardinghelli-ddd90a.netlify.app/ and sign up for a new account. If you have already signed up, use your email and password to sign in. Search for the artwork titles you are interested in. For example: "Quail and Millet". This specific search term should return 7 artworks as a result. You can then favorite/unfavorite in the search page. You can click on "Favorites" to see all the artworks you have favorited. Unfavoriting an artwork from the Favorites page will remove it from the page.
